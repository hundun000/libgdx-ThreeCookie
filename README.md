This project created in [low-effort-jam-22](https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-22) for the theme `Three`

## ThreeeCookie

A clicker game, demo version. Special design for the theme is the numbers in the game are base on "3", even the timer cycle is 3 seconds.

This is the first time I use my idle-framework with html-subproject. This project is a short demo version for testing the idle-framework abilities and the html exported.
